Russia is the biggest destination of Japanese cut flowers from JPEC in 2021. We shipped Prunus, Spiraea, Lindera, Ranunculus, Lisianthus, Lathyrus, Epidendrum, Cymbidium. Our partner in Moscow made display at their Cash and Carry place, also they give flowers to the customers (Designers, Florists, Floral school eachers, Instagramers). We can confirm many nice activities by our partner and customers in Instagram with #japanflower. We had good experience with Russian customers, and we hope it makes more and more customers in Russia who can enjoy our Japanese flowers!</description></item><item><title>2020 result</title><link>/en/news/20210624/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/20210624/</guid><description>not ready</description></item></channel></rss>
